# VisitorPortal

[Deutsch](README.de.md)

VisitorPortal is a web-based visitor management system for registering, managing and checking in company visitors.

It supports visitor pre-registration, reception workflows, printable visitor badges, a welcome monitor, notifications, and role-based access control.

## Project Status

VisitorPortal is a production-oriented visitor management system first developed as part of a student team project. Its implemented core workflows are functional and can support real-world visitor management scenarios, including visit registration, reception check-in, visitor badges, email notifications, role-based access control, and welcome monitor displays.

Although the implemented workflows are designed to be usable in practice, the project should not be deployed in a real organization without an additional security, privacy, and operational review.
The application processes potentially personal data such as visitor names, companies, contact details, visit times, and check-in/check-out timestamps. Before using it in a real organization, review legal requirements, retention policies, access control, logging, backups, and deployment security.

## Features

- **Receptionist notifications**: Check-in alerts routed to designated department receptionists
- Queue and scheduler support for background tasks
- Light, dark, system, and true black themes
- White-label branding via environment configuration
- Docker-based demo setup with prebuilt application image

## Organization and Site Model

VisitorPortal is designed for one organization per instance.
Multiple sites/locations within one organization are supported.
For legally separate organizations, run separate instances unless full multi-tenancy is explicitly implemented and audited.

Sites represent physical locations such as receptions, plants, offices, or buildings. Visits, monitors, reception views, and host/substitute selections are scoped by site so one reception desk does not automatically see operational data from another location.

Visitor master records are organization-wide contacts. Site isolation applies to visits, monitors, operational visibility, and host/substitute assignments, not to the visitor contact record itself.

## Which ZIP Should I Download?

- `VisitorPortal-demo-vX.Y.Z.zip`: use this for a quick local demo with Docker and the bundled start scripts.
- `besucherportal-vX.Y.Z.zip`: use this for source-based review or deployment work.
- GitHub's auto-generated `Source code` archives: use only when you specifically want the raw repository snapshot.

Do not use demo credentials or demo seed data in production. See [Release Artifacts](docs/release-artifacts.md) for details.

## Quick Start: Demo Setup

The demo setup is intended for non-technical users. It uses a prebuilt Docker image, so PHP, Composer, npm, and frontend build tools are not required on the host machine.

Requirements:

- Current Docker Desktop or Docker Engine with Docker Compose v2

Start the demo on Windows:

```bat
start.bat
```

Start the demo on macOS/Linux:

```bash
sh start.sh
```

After startup:

- Application: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- Mailhog: [http://localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025)

On first start, the script creates a local `.env.demo` from `.env.demo.example`. If these ports are already in use, adjust `APP_PORT` and `MAILHOG_PORT` in `.env.demo`.

Stop the demo:

```bash
sh stop.sh
```

Reset demo data:

```bash
sh reset-demo.sh
```

Update the demo image:

```bash
sh update.sh
```

Windows users can use the matching `.bat` scripts.

In the source repository, `.env.demo.example` contains `RELEASE_VERSION_PLACEHOLDER`. Official release ZIPs replace that placeholder with the published release tag so demos are reproducible:

```env
VISITORPORTAL_VERSION=v1.0.2
```

## Demo Accounts

All demo accounts use the same password: `ChangeMe-42!`

| Role | Email | Password |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Admin | `admin@example.org` | `ChangeMe-42!` |
| Reception | `reception@example.org` | `ChangeMe-42!` |
| Employee | `employee@example.org` | `ChangeMe-42!` |
| Manager | `manager@example.org` | `ChangeMe-42!` |
| Welcome monitor | `welcome@example.org` | `ChangeMe-42!` |
| Security/reception | `security@example.org` | `ChangeMe-42!` |

The seeders also create 20 additional Faker-based users, 50 additional Faker-based visitors, and 50 to 100 demo visits. Demo email addresses use reserved `example.org`, `example.com`, or `example.net` domains. Demo phone numbers use reserved media/demo number ranges in E.164 format or are intentionally blank. Demo seeders are blocked in `APP_ENV=production`.

## Development Setup

The developer setup uses the source-mounted `docker-compose.yml`.

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
docker compose run --rm web composer install
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose exec web php artisan key:generate
docker compose exec web php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

Application:

- [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

Vite development server:

- [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

More setup details are documented in [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md). Operational monitoring and health checks are documented in [docs/operations.md](docs/operations.md).

## Tests and Quality Checks

Run the test suite inside the development container:

```bash
docker compose exec web php artisan test
```

Run a targeted test file:

```bash
docker compose exec web php artisan test tests/Feature/Receptionist/ReceptionAdministerVisitTest.php
```

Run Laravel Pint style checks:

```bash
docker compose exec web ./vendor/bin/pint --test -v
```

Build frontend assets:

```bash
docker compose run --rm node npm run build
```

The GitHub Actions workflow runs PHP setup, Pint, migrations, and tests against MariaDB.

## Configuration and White Labeling

VisitorPortal has a central branding configuration in `backend/config/branding.php`.

### Single Sign-On

VisitorPortal can be configured for generic OpenID Connect SSO. The implementation is provider-independent and is intended for enterprise identity providers such as Microsoft Entra ID, Keycloak, Authentik, Okta and other OIDC-compatible systems.

SSO is disabled by default. Local authentication remains available unless `AUTH_MODE=sso_only` is configured. In `sso_only`, local login is reserved for break-glass accounts with the `LoginLocallyInSsoOnlyMode` permission.

Common environment variables:

- `BRANDING_NAME`
- `BRANDING_LOGO_LIGHT`
- `BRANDING_LOGO_DARK`
- `BRANDING_MAIL_LOGO`
- `BRANDING_BADGE_LOGO`
- `BRANDING_BADGE_DESIGN` (`standard` or `photo_qr`)
- `BRANDING_BADGE_ACCENT_COLOR`
- `BRANDING_MONITOR_FALLBACK_HEADING`
- `BRANDING_MONITOR_FALLBACK_SUBHEADING`
- `BRANDING_MONITOR_SLIDE_HEADING`

The default assets are stored in `backend/public/images/branding/`.

For production-like deployments, explicitly review these demo defaults:

- `APP_DEBUG`
- `APP_KEY`
- database credentials
- mail settings
- `AUTO_MIGRATE`
- `AUTO_SEED`
- `FORCE_SEED`
- `APP_URL`
- HTTPS/reverse proxy configuration
